# SteamMaster

This is a work in progress in the end the objective is to have an app that alows you to edit any achievement idle games and some other things.
The current UI is a copy of the existing "SAM (Steam Achievement Manager by gibbed)" to make tings easier for me, this will be changed in future versions.
